# Simply Tuples
A small open-source project that add tuples to Java in a simple way.

## Notes
- This is a very fresh project, it may has continues big changes.
- The project supports `Tuple1` - `Tuple5` (1-5 elements per tuple) and will not add support for larger tuples,
since we believe that it is better after that to build and use your custom classes.

#### TODO
- Documentation
- Build immutable versions of the tuples (or modify current ones).
- Methods:
  - append
  - prepend
  - merge / expand
  - Increase limit to 10
  - move asTuple... methods implementation to sub classes (?)
- Check Apache common, Scala tuples and 'javatuples' implementations.
